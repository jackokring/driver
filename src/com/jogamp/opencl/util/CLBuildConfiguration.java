/**
 * Configuration representing everything needed to build an OpenCL program.
 * <p>
 * If you use {@link #save(java.io.ObjectOutputStream)} to persist build configurations between
 * JVM sessions it is highly recommended to call {@link #forDevice(com.jogamp.opencl.CLDevice) }
 * or {@link #forDevices(com.jogamp.opencl.CLDevice[]) } before building the program.
 * Driver updates or HW changes can make exact device-to-binary mapping hard, the
 * builder will drop all unmappable binaries silently. Setting the devices explicitly will
 * force automatic rebuilds from source in this situation.
